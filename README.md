# NexChem — Chemometric Modeling Platform

NexChem is an interactive, browser-based application for building and evaluating regression models from spectroscopy and analytical chemistry data. It is designed for analytical chemists and researchers who want to apply chemometric methods without writing code.

Built with [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io), NexChem guides you step-by-step from raw spectra to validated predictive models with publication-ready diagnostic plots.

## Features

**Data Loading**
- Upload Raman spectra (`.spc` files) as a `.zip` archive
- Upload reference Y-block data (Excel `.xlsx`)
- Automatic sample ID matching between spectra and reference data

**Preprocessing**
- Savitzky-Golay derivative + SNV + global mean-centering
- AsLS baseline correction + Savitzky-Golay smoothing + SNV
- Replicate-averaging with group-level preprocessing
- Crop-only (no normalization)
- Preprocessing state is saved and automatically applied to prediction sets — no data leakage

**Regression Modeling**
- Partial Least Squares (PLS) with automatic or manual component selection
- Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) regression with grid search cross-validation
- Standard K-Fold and Group K-Fold cross-validation
- One model built per analyte column in your Y-block

**Diagnostic Plots**
- CV predicted vs. actual
- R² and RMSECV curves
- PLS: VIP scores, regression coefficients, T²/Q residuals, LV score plot
- MLP: permutation feature importance
- All plots saved as PNG and PDF to your output directory

**Prediction**
- Apply a trained model to an external prediction set
- Optional: upload reference Y values to compute R²_pred and RMSEP
- Results saved as CSV

**PCA**
- PCA score plot with selectable principal components
- 95% confidence ellipses per class
- PCA loadings plot with annotated top bands

## Installation

### One-Click Launcher (Recommended)

If you downloaded NexChem from the GitHub release page, a one-click launcher is included.

1. Download the NexChem release archive.
2. Extract the folder.
3. Double-click the launcher for your operating system:

- **Mac / Linux:** `Launch_NexChem.command`
- **Windows:** `Launch_NexChem.bat`

The launcher will automatically start the NexChem Streamlit application and open it in your web browser.


### 2. Manual Installation

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate nexchem_env
```

This installs all dependencies including `ramanspy`, `chemometrics`, and the `spc` file reader.

> **Note:** The `spc` package is installed directly from GitHub. An internet connection is required for the first install.

### 3. Launch the app

```bash
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

The app will open automatically in your browser at `http://localhost:8501`.

## Quick Start

### Preparing your files

**Raman spectra** should be Thermo `.spc` files named using this convention:

```
SampleID-Replicate_acquisition-params.spc
```

Examples:
```
188-1_450mw_10s.spc
188-2_450mw_10s.spc
188-3_450mw_10s.spc
190-1_450mw_10s.spc
```

The number before the dash (`188`, `190`) is the sample group ID. The number after the dash is the replicate number. Everything after the underscore is ignored.

Pack all `.spc` files for one dataset into a single `.zip` file before uploading.

**Reference data (Y-block)** must be an Excel file with:
- An `ID` column matching the sample group IDs in the spectra names
- One column per target analyte (e.g., `DHA`, `EPA`, `PUFA`)
- An optional `Class` column for coloring plots

Example:

| ID  | Class | DHA  | EPA  | PUFA |
|-----|-------|------|------|------|
| 188 | 2022  | 10.5 | 5.1  | 15.6 |
| 190 | 2023  | 1.5  | 1.0  | 2.5  |

### Running a model

1. **Data Loading tab** — Set an output directory, then upload your `.zip` spectra file and your Y-block Excel file. Click **Load calibration data**.
2. **Preprocessing tab** — Choose a preprocessing method, adjust parameters if needed, and click **Run Preprocessing**.
3. **Modeling tab** — Choose a model (PLS or MLP), set cross-validation options, and click **Train Model**. Diagnostic plots appear automatically.
4. **Prediction tab** — Upload a new `.zip` of spectra. Optionally upload a Y-block for that set. Click **Run Prediction**.
5. **PCA tab** — Visualize your preprocessed data in PCA space with class-colored groupings.

All results are saved to the output directory you set in step 1.

## Adding a New Regression Model

NexChem uses a registry-based architecture. To add a new model type (e.g., SVR):

1. Add a wrapper function `SVR_model(...)` in `models/wrappers.py` following the same compute / plot / shim pattern as `PLS_model`. Populate `result['diagnostic_plots']` and `result['model_type']` in the returned dict.
2. Add an adapter in `models/run_loops.py`:
   ```python
   def _run_svr(X, y, results_dir, axis, analyte, groups, n_folds,
                sample_ids, class_labels, manual_param=None, param_grid=None):
       return SVR_model(...)
   ```
3. Register it:
   ```python
   MODEL_REGISTRY["SVR"] = _run_svr
   ```
4. Add `"SVR"` to the model selectbox in `streamlit_app.py`.

The diagnostic plot rendering in Tab 3 is generic — it reads `diagnostic_plots` from the result dict, so no other UI changes are needed.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. If you find a bug or want to add a feature:

1. Fork the repository and create a branch from `main`.
2. Make your changes with clear, focused commits.
3. Ensure the app runs without errors by testing in the Streamlit UI.
4. Open a pull request with a description of what was changed and why.

For major changes (new model types, new preprocessing pipelines, UI redesigns), please open an issue first to discuss the approach.
